# FreezeKill
A new bukkit plugin requested by user PhillyCheezsteak on the Bukkit request plugin forum

The intent of this plugin is to freeze a player for a specified amount of time.
In this time they are required to kill and entity or player in order to be set free. If they fail
then they will die and respawn.

The intent is also to try and make mobs hostile to this player as well.
